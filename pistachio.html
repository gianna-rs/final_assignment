    <h2>Pistachio Bark Cookies</h2>
    <p>Makes approx. 24 cookies</p>
    <p>
      The only kind of chocolate bark I've ever liked is the white chocolate
      bark with pistachios and cranberries. So why not make my favourite bark
      into a great sugar cookie!

      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a mixer or with a hand mixer, beat softened butter until smooth.
          Add both sugars and mix on medium speed until light in colour. Add egg
          and vanilla and beat on high speed until well incorporated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mix all dry ingredients together in a separate bowl. Slowly mix dry
          ingredients into wet ingredients on low speed until just combined. Add
          chocolate, cranberries and pistachios - dough will be very thick and
          chunky!
        </li>
        <li>
          Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to
          2 days. You have to chill this dough otherwise your cookies will
          spread and melt in the oven!
        </li>
        <li>
          After chilling, let your dough sit at room temperature for 10-20
          minutes or until slightly softened - it'll be easier to work with!
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat your oven to 350&deg; and prepare 2 large baking sheets with
          parchment paper or baking mats.
        </li>
        <li>
          Scoop 1 tbsp size balls of dough onto your prepared baking sheets.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake 5-10 minutes or until the edges are lightly golden brown - the
          cookies will still look really soft!
        </li>
        <li>
          Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 more minutes before
          moving them to a cooling rack. Once completely cool, take a bite and
          enjoy!
